## Abstract

This project aims to explore and interpret the data on Arizona's enduring drought conditions, a climatic challenge that disrupts the balance of life and has adverse effects on the state's future. The investigation is driven by a combination of curiosity and the recognition of water scarcity as an issue that is deeply connected to Arizona's residents.

By exploring this database, we seek to gain valuable insights into the dynamic nature of Arizona's drought experiences. Our recent interactions with individuals actively raising awareness about the dire drought situation and the adverse effects of water wastage have further inspired this exploration. The project's objective is not only to provide valuable data for our visualization but also to offer a profound understanding of the challenges faced by the state.

We aim to create easy-to-understand visuals that depict the current situation and stimulate thinking about potential solutions. A close examination of how different areas are dealing with water shortages will help us determine where to focus our efforts to contribute to the mitigation of this issue. Through this project, we hope to shed light on the severity of the drought and inspire action towards sustainable water management practices in Arizona.
